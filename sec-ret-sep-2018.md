<!-- TITLE: secRet (Sep 2018) -->

# About
The first re-union, meeting and lab of secRet will be held at **FabLab** in **Falconara Marittima (An)**. **14/15/16 sep**
We will spend 3 days together, using 18 hours (6 per days) with lot of beer and training reverse engineering mobile apps, malware, binaries.
I'll personally share all the tricks i've found, how i've developed my debugger while debugging and instrumenting ARM binaries and lot more.

# Location and sits
The location which will host our lab sessions is very big however, we want to keep a short number of participants to ensure the right focus and debat opportunity. 
It will be a traning even for me and for anyone of us since we will may attempt to explore something new, which is also a topic of the training on how to approach something that we don't fuc!@ç£king know.

**8/12** 

We can accept more people in case of max number reached. Feel free to contact me through slack (link in homepage) <-- really... im too lazy to do an "an ``<a href="">`` which by the way, I just did.

# Price
The access is totally free, however we can't actually provide an accomodation for all the people. I'll try to make a deal with a local hotel to have some good discount, t-shirts and beer will be covered by us. 

# Requirements
* A general application development background
* Confidence with writing (or at least understanding) C, Python, JavaScript
* A laptop with any linux distribution (virtualized is fine as well, please make sure everything works fine in advance)
* A rooted android device
* ADB, python
* A decompiler (any of IDA, BinaryNinja, Hopper, Radare)
* Android NDK (not needed, but we will eventually show how to attach and work with gdb + gef)
* Frida (you can pre-install it, we will quickly cover frida setup)
* A comfortable IDE for coding C, Python and JavaScript (I suggest IntelliJ ultimate - there is a free 1 month trial with all the needed plugins)
# Table of content
For what concerne the training/lab as I said, i'll share and explain in details the following topics:

* debug and instrument the java side
* debug and instrument the native side
* alter the flow of the program with arbitrary code injection
* various trick to obtain what we need including: dynamically load blobs, read and access threads information, posix threads and context switch
* we will eventually explore something i personally never seen once to understand how to approach to something totally new

-> **more details about the complete program (including an afteernon at the beach if the sun will shine over us) will be posted very soon!

This is, at first and at most, an occasion for me (for us) to meet people and exchange ideas, eventually build stuffs that we will push to github streight after the event. I'm very happy to share what i know to people that have passion and interest in the matter.
I won't stop anyone that wish to join, from joining us, however, we are not going to cover the ARM assembly instruction set, and we assume that whoever wish to learn have enough time to build the needed background before the date of the meeting!

# More info
Due to the probably partecipation of secRet guys from outside Italy, the entire lab could be (at 99%) be in English.
