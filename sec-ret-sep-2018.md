<!-- TITLE: secRet (Sep 2018) -->

# About
The first re-union, meeting and lab of secRet will be held at **FabLab** in **Falconara Marittima (An)**. **14/15/16 sep**
We will spend 3 days together, using 18 hours (6 per days) with lot of beer and training reverse engineering mobile apps, malware, binaries.
I'll personally share all the tricks i've found, how i've developed my debugger while debugging and instrumenting ARM binaries and lot more.

# Location and sits
The location which will host our lab sessions is very big however, we want to keep a short number of participants to ensure the right focus and debat opportunity. 
It will be a traning even for me and for anyone of us since we will may attempt to explore something new, which is also a topic of the training on how to approach something that we don't fuc!@ç£king know.

**8/12** 

We can accept more people in case of max number reached. Feel free to contact me through slack (link in homepage) <-- really... im too lazy to do an "an ``<a href="">`` which by the way, I just did.

# Price
The access is totally free, however we can't actually provide an accomodation for all the people. I'll try to make a deal with a local hotel to have some good discount, t-shirts and beer will be covered by us. 

# Requirements
* A general application development background
* Confidence with writing (or at least understanding) C, Python, JavaScript
* A laptop with any linux distribution (virtualized is fine as well, please make sure everything works fine in advance)
* A rooted android device
* ADB, python
* A decompiler (any of IDA, BinaryNinja, Hopper, Radare)
* Android NDK (not needed, but we will eventually show how to attach and work with gdb + gef)

* A comfortable IDE for coding C, Python and JavaScript (I suggest IntelliJ ultimate - there is a free 1 month trial with all the needed plugins)
